<h2>The Saudi Aramco IPO</h2>
<p>While reports of the company going public on the financial market have been present for quite some time, in early November, Saudi Arabia’s market regulator officially announced that Aramco will hold a domestic listing on the Riyadh Stock Exchange. As with all IPOs, Saudi Aramco enlisted several major banks to serve as underwriters for the offering. Among these banks are major names, such as Goldman Sachs, and the Bank of America.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the company will raise at least $25.6 billion, giving it a minimal market cap of $1.6 trillion. The market cap instantly positions it as one of the world’s largest publicly-traded companies and the largest of the national oil companies.</p>
<p>Following the domestic listing in Saudi Arabia, the company is reportedly planning additional offerings in 2020 on the New York, London, Hong Kong, and SingSaudi Aramco.

That’s as much as Apple, Google and Exxon Mobile earned, combined.</p>
<h2>What Impacts the Saudi Aramco Stock?</h2>
